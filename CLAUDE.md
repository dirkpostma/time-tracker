# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A CLI application for tracking time spent on projects.

## Data Model

Hierarchy: **Client > Project > Task (optional) > TimeEntry**

- **Client**: Top-level entity (company/individual you work for)
- **Project**: Belongs to a client
- **Task**: Optional, belongs to a project
- **TimeEntry**: Start/end timestamps for work sessions

Storage: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

## Development Approach

- Spec-based development. Specs live in `/specs` and define features before implementation.
- Test-driven development. All features should be implemented test-first.
